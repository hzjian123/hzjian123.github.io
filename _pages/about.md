I am an AI Engineer focused on Vision-Language Models (VLM), Vision-Language-Action (VLA), Embodied AI, and Foundation Models for Robotics and Autonomous Driving. I received my Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UC San Diego.<br>

This website serves as a space to share my projects, research interests, technical explorations, and thoughts on AI, robotics, travel, and life. My recent work includes VLM/VLA systems, stereo vision, multimodal learning, autonomous driving, and robotics foundation models.<br>

Outside of technology, I enjoy exploring different countries, cultures, and landscapes. Traveling and living in different environments gradually changed my perspective on life beyond large metropolitan cities and encouraged me to pursue a more adventurous and open-ended path. I believe curiosity, adaptability, and embracing uncertainty are important not only in research, but also in life itself.<br>

# 🎓 Projects
[**Conditional Diffusion Model for Image Super‐Resolution**](https://github.com/hzjian123/Deep-Image-HDR-with-Attention)
- Implemented a conditional diffusion model based on the SR3 model to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs.
- Modified the training objective to predict residual between output and input, leading to faster convergence and improved preservation of details.
- Infused low-resolution inputs into bottleneck layers to enhance output consistency, resulting in improvements of PSNR (23.1) and SSIM (0.69).\
[**Network Systems Project**](https://github.com/hzjian123/cloud-file-storage-system)
- Developed a web server for data retrieval using a custom HTTP/1.1 protocol which is robust to invalid request. Built a cloud‐based file storage service with metadata and data block server based on Dropbox, support concurrent data access by gRPC.
- Implemented a distributed data blocks storage system with consistent hashing algorithm for efficient and fault‐tolerant data storage.
- Replicated metadata server for fault‐tolerance and consistency, using the RAFT consensus protocol for consistent state machine updates.\
**Deep Learning for Image Captioning on Fliker 8K Dataset**
- Constructed an Encoder-Decoder structure with ResNet and LSTM respectively, and trained the model sequentially to generate captions with a unigram BLEU score of 0.28.
- Improved the caption generation ability by introducing the soft attention mask and achieved a BLEU score of 0.26.
- Further enhanced the model by replacing the encoder with a pre-trained Vision Transformer and the decoder with GPT-2, resulting in a total BLEU score of 0.53.\
