I am a recent graduate of the Master's program in Electrical Computer Engineering at UC San Diego. Aspiring to create my personal portfolio, I have set up this platform to share ideas and express myself. Currently, I have returned to Hong Kong after leaving San Diego:)<br>
In the past, I used to gravitate towards big cities, following trends and being influenced by the people around me. However, I had a realization about the side effects of metropolitan living, such as pollution and limited living space. This led me to explore more possibilities in life, including studying a new major and traveling to new countries. Now, I consider myself an adventurer and trailblazer, and I believe this attribute will greatly enrich my life.<br>
My interests are quite diverse, ranging from sports to music. On this website, I have documented some of my proudest moments, which you can access below...<br>

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3ZqwcEYAAAAJ&hl'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>64+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3ZqwcEYAAAAJ&hl'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

# üéì Projects
[**Conditional Diffusion Model for Image Super‚ÄêResolution**](https://github.com/hzjian123/Deep-Image-HDR-with-Attention)
- Implemented a conditional diffusion model based on the SR3 model to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs.
- Modified the training objective to predict residual between output and input, leading to faster convergence and improved preservation of details.
- Infused low-resolution inputs into bottleneck layers to enhance output consistency, resulting in improvements of PSNR (23.1) and SSIM (0.69).
[**Network Systems Project**](https://github.com/hzjian123/cloud-file-storage-system)
- Developed a web server for data retrieval using a custom HTTP/1.1 protocol which is robust to invalid request.‚Ä®Built a cloud‚Äêbased file storage service with metadata and data block server based on Dropbox, support concurrent data access by gRPC.
- Implemented a distributed data blocks storage system with consistent hashing algorithm for efficient and fault‚Äêtolerant data storage.
- Replicated metadata server for fault‚Äêtolerance and consistency, using the RAFT consensus protocol for consistent state machine updates.
